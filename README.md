# Arduino DHT Sensor Data to Firebase

This Arduino sketch reads temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and sends the data to Firebase Realtime Database.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., ESP32)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Access to Firebase Realtime Database

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Libraries:**
   - Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:
     - [Firebase ESP32 Client](https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP32)
     - [DHT Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)

2. **Update Wi-Fi Credentials:**
   - Replace `ssid` and `password` in the sketch with your Wi-Fi network credentials.

3. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Replace `FIREBASE_HOST` with your Firebase Realtime Database URL.
   - Replace `FIREBASE_AUTH` with your Firebase Legacy Authentication token.

4. **Connect DHT Sensor:**
   - Connect your DHT11 sensor to the specified digital pin (`DHTPIN`).

5. **Upload and Run:**
   - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board and open the Serial Monitor to view temperature, humidity, and Firebase interaction logs.

## Firebase Database Structure

- Data is stored under the `/DHT11` node in Firebase with the following structure:
  ```
  /DHT11
      /Humidity: <value>
      /Temperature: <value>
      /HeatIndexC: <value>
      /HeatIndexF: <value>
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Sensor Read Failures:** If readings fail, check sensor wiring and connections.
- **Firebase Errors:** Ensure correct Firebase credentials and network connectivity.
